== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any sort of external special license file or key required to run my zTransitions slider? =

No.

= Can I have multiple zTransitions galleries on the same webpage? =

Yes.

= What happens if I try to make zTransitions’ sliders using different sized images and videos? =

zTransitions will automatically take care of any non conforming image or video dimensions by scaling and centering everything to always fit into the master width and height settings. The auto computed master width and height settings can also be overridden in the Basic Settings panel under the Global Settings tab.

= Are zTransitions’ sliders 100% CSS responsive no matter what screen resolution the user has? =

Yes. This option can also be overridden in the Basic Settings panel under the Global Settings tab.

= Will zTransitions’ sliders run on any desktop browser? =

Yes. It has been extensively tested to run and render as fast as possible on even older desktop browsers.

= Will zTransitions’ sliders run on mobile browsers? =

Yes. It has been extensively tested to run and render as fast as possible on even older mobile browsers.

= Can the zTransitions slider design app be used on mobile browsers? =

No. The zTransitions app was not designed to be used on mobile browsers as it was felt that it would be as difficult to make a slider on a phone or tablet as it is to edit Photoshop on a phone or tablet.

However, this decision may change in the future depending on customer requests.

= How do I implement a streaming video into my zTransitions slider? =

Regular MP4 video format is not designed for sustained streaming and automatic quality bitrate switching though it is capable of fast start play back.

You will need to specify a HTTP URL pointed to a specially encoded .m3u8 format video in order to take advantage of streaming video features. In the near future, zTransitions will offer a streaming video encoding and conversion web service built into the zTransitions app that can convert your regular MP4 videos into streaming video format.
